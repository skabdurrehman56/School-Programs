# School Programs

This repository contains a collection of **basic Python practice programs** given by my school teacher. It is designed to help beginners understand and practice foundational Python concepts while building confidence in programming.

---

## Features
- Beginner-friendly programs to strengthen fundamental concepts.
- Covers key Python topics such as:
  - Variables
  - Loops (for, while)
  - Conditionals (if-else statements)
  - Functions
  - Input/Output operations
  - Basic data structures (lists, tuples, etc.)
- Ideal for students starting their Python journey or revisiting the basics.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/School-Programs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd School-Programs
   ```
3. Open and run the programs using any Python IDE or command line:
   ```bash
   python program_name.py
   ```

## Structure
Each program is saved with a meaningful name to indicate its purpose. Programs are grouped based on topics for easy navigation.

Example folder structure:
```
School-Programs/
├── variables_programs/
│   └── variables_example.py
├── loops_programs/
│   └── for_loop_example.py
